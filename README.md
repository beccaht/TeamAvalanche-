# TeamAvalanche-
Givv Project


## Setup
To get started running the app, it runs with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) v6+ and utilizes [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the database. If you don't have those installed, make sure to do so. Then, clone the project and run `npm install` and then `npm start` should get it going for you. `npm install` will install all the required packages including things like [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/), [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/), [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt), and [express-brute](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-brute).

Once you've got it running, you should be able to open the login page by going to port 5144 (by default, can be changed).
